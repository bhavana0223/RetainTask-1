## 1. Code Organization (25%)

### Improvem\* Introduced **structured logging** across the application:

- Info logs for key actions (User Created, User Updated, Login Success/Fail).
- Error logs for exceptions and invalid inputs.
- Ensures better observability and traceability in production.
- Used Python's built-in **logging module** for scalable log handling.
- **Database transaction management** with proper commit/rollback handling.
- **Custom exception classes** for better error handling (`UserNotFoundError`, `UserAlreadyExistsError`).
- **Thread-safe database connections** using thread-local storage.
- **Database triggers** for automatic timestamp updates.
- **Database indexes** for improved query performance.
- Clean and reusable **database connection utility (`db.py`)**.
- Added minimal yet critical API tests in `tests/`.
- Modularized codebase into **routes, models, db, utils, config** for separation of concerns.
- Organized directory structure:

  ```
  user_management/
  ├── app.py
  ├── config.py          # Configuration management
  ├── db.py              # Enhanced with transactions
  ├── models.py          # Business logic layer
  ├── utils.py           # Validation and security utilities
  ├── routes/user_routes.py
  ├── tests/test_users.py
  └── requirements.txt
  ```

- Used **Flask Blueprints** for route organization.
- Added **configuration management** for better maintainability.
- Added a **tests** directory for API test automation.
- **Database transaction management** with context managers.

## 2. Security Improvements (25%)

### Improvements:

- Eliminated **SQL Injection vulnerabilities** using **parameterized queries**.
- Added **bcrypt hashing** for passwords with proper salt rounds.
- Implemented **input validation utilities** for request payloads (e.g., email format, password length).
- **Fixed thread safety issues** by changing `check_same_thread=True` in database connections.
- **Enhanced input sanitization** with length limits and regex patterns.
- **Database constraints** added for data integrity (email uniqueness, password length).
- Removed any hard-coded sensitive logs (like plaintext passwords).
- Consistent **error responses** with correct HTTP status codes.

## 3. Best Practices (25%)

### Improvements:

- Introduced **structured logging** across the application:

  - Info logs for key actions (User Created, User Updated, Login Success/Fail).
  - Error logs for exceptions and invalid inputs.
  - Ensures better observability and traceability in production.

- Used Python’s built-in **logging module** for scalable log handling.
- Clean and reusable **database connection utility (`db.py`)**.
- Added minimal yet critical API tests in `tests/`.

### Example Logs Added:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Example usage
logging.info("User created successfully: %s", email)
logging.error("Database operation failed: %s", str(e))
```

### Trade-offs:

- Full logging configuration (file rotation, external log aggregation) is kept simple to match project size.
- Focused on actionable logs rather than verbose debug logs.

## 4. Documentation

### Changes Documented:

- Documented refactoring and improvements in this **CHANGES.md**.
- Function and variable names are meaningful for self-documenting code.
- Added a **DB initialization script** for onboarding/setup.
- Explained architectural decisions and trade-offs clearly.
- Provided sample API JSON payloads for testing.

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Start Flask App**: `python app.py`
3. **Test API endpoints**: Use Postman, cURL, or browser
4. **API available at**: `http://127.0.0.1:5009`

### Sample API Usage:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://127.0.0.1:5009/

# Get all users
curl http://127.0.0.1:5009/users

# Create a user
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5009/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"securepass123"}'
```
